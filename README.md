## Overview
A custom audio visualizer printed circuit board (PCB), designed using KiCad and programmed with Arduino and C++, featuring interrupt-driven C++ logic to synchronize RGB LED animations with real-time audio dynamics. This design processes audio signals and displays dynamic patterns onto two 8x8 RGB LED matrices.

## Components
- **Arduino Mega 2560**: microcontroller for processing audio signals and controlling the LED matrix
- **Custom PCB**: custom-designed printed circuit board shield for Arduino
- **8x8 RGB LED Matrix**: dynamic visualization of audio signals
- **3.5mm Audio Jack**: allows for audio input from external devices
